Features
-----------
-Support resource management of CPU cores and GPU cores.
-Manage memory transfer among CPU cores and GPU cores.
-Enable three task running models including ONLY_GPU, ONLY_GPU and BOTH
-Enable users to specify the preferred implementation running on CPU with JAVA (by default) and OMP (OpenMP)
-Provide PMap and PReduce programming interfaces to programmers
